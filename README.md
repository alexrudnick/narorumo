## *narorumo* is where Lindsey Kuper and Alex Rudnick put side projects -- _awesome_ side projects.

(most of these are somewhat older -- things we started back when we mostly hosted things on Google Code)

  * *new!*: our [utterly rad submission](https://github.com/teamKandR/narorumo/tree/master/icfp11) for the [ 2011 ICFP Programming Contest](http://icfpcontest.org), made of Python, Scheme, and SKI combinator calculus.  We did better in 2011 than ever before, and [as the data clearly indicate](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmeWqfwe_WDmdEhsZkx0MkhtZm1sLVgyeGVpaUZiNnc&hl=en_US#gid=0), we're on track to win the ICFP Contest in roughly 2016.  That's how math works, right?

  * [programs that run backwards](https://github.com/teamKandR/narorumo/tree/master/minikanren-stuff), made of [miniKanren](http://iucs-relational-research.googlecode.com).

  * (solutions to problems](https://github.com/teamKandR/narorumo/tree/master/problemset) from [this collection](http://streamtech.nl/site/problem+set), made of Python and Scheme and little pieces of Lindsey's soul.

  * our  [freakin' sweet submission](https://github.com/teamKandR/narorumo/tree/master/icfp09) for the [2009 ICFP Programming Contest](http://icfpcontest.org), made of Scheme, Python, R, and orbital mechanics.

  * our [totally awesome submission](https://github.com/teamKandR/narorumo/tree/master/icfp08) for the [2008 ICFP Programming Contest](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~sheard/2008IcfpContest/), made of Scheme and trigonometry.

  * [exercises](https://github.com/teamKandR/narorumo/tree/master/sicp) from _[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) _, made of Scheme and love.

  * [sudokusolver](https://github.com/teamKandR/narorumo/tree/master/sudokusolver), made of Python and combinatorics and double exclamation points!!

  * [perturbation](https://github.com/teamKandR/narorumo/tree/master/perturbation), made of Python and Perl and a crazy idea Lindsey had in the shower one day.

  * [automated poetry](https://github.com/teamKandR/narorumo/tree/master/sleep-furiously), made of Python.

  * ...lots of other stuff, actually.  You're welcome to [dig around](https://github.com/teamKandR/narorumo/tree/master/)!
