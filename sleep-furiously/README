sleep-furiously is the second iteration of my poetry generator project.

The first iteration, which was a class project when I was a student at Georgia
Tech, was done in Common Lisp and called TEB (for "Trurl's Electronic Bard",
after Stanislaw Lem's Cyberiad).

The ircbot code is forked from the project ircbot-collection, at
http://code.google.com/p/ircbot-collection/, by the Red Bean Software folks.
