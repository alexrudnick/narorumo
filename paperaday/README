paperaday is a tiny program to send you one URL every day.

James Clawson once told me that the way to become a godlike researcher (I'm
pretty sure that he used the word "godlike", in fact), was to do these three
things:

1) read a paper every day
2) write a paper every semester (at least)
3) learn some new technology every month

So paperaday will help you with the first one. You're otherwise on your own.

paperaday.py youremail@host.com \
  --tosend=/path/to/URLstosend \
  --sent=/path/to/URLsalreadysent \
  --message=/path/to/personalmessage

When you run paperaday.py, if will take the first line of the file URLstosend,
email it to you, remove that first line from the file, and append it to the
file URLsalreadysent, with a date stamp for when it was sent. Of course you can
name these two files whatever you want. The contents of the file
"personalmessage" are also included in the email, if that flag is specified.

To make paperaday.py run every day, put it in your crontab!
